# Lab 1 - *Tumblr_feed*

**Tumblr_feed** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would want to extend the app to include the description/story to go with the images.
2. Implement a way to review and favorite an image.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

There were several challenges that I cam across when creating this app. The first was understanding how to get rid of outlets. I had a problem where there were two outlets to the same UIImageView. Additionally, I had some difficulty scaling the image to fit within my app. This was resolved by simple trial and error.

## Notes

The only challenge I had was making the UI spacing appear nice and pretty.
